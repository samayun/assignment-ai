Problem formulation must follow goal formulation in AI development because it ensures that all aspects of the AI's process are directed towards achieving the specified goal. Here's a structured explanation:

1. **Goal Formulation**: This step involves clearly defining what success looks like for the problem. For example, in a maze-solving task, the goal is to find the shortest path from the start to the exit.

2. **Problem Formulation**: Following the goal definition, this step translates the goal into something the AI can work on. It involves:
   - Defining the search space (e.g., each cell in the maze as a state).
   - Identifying possible actions (e.g., moving north, south, east, or west in the maze).
   - Establishing the successor function, which maps each action to its outcome (e.g., moving forward and ending up in a new state).

3. **Alignment with Goal**: Knowing the goal upfront helps prioritize paths that lead towards it. It ensures that the AI's search is targeted and efficient, avoiding unnecessary detours or loops.

4. **Example Application**: In a pathfinding algorithm for a robot, defining the goal as navigating from the start to a target position without obstacles allows the problem formulation to focus on relevant states (positions) and actions (movements). Without this 
alignment, it would be challenging to determine which states are valuable and how they contribute to reaching the goal.

In summary, formulating the problem after setting the goals ensures that every step of the AI's process is aligned towards achieving the defined objective, leading to a more efficient and effective search.
