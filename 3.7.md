Each of these problems can be approached using state-space search with a priority queue, such as the A* algorithm. Here's a structured approach to solving each:

### Part (a): Coloring a Planar Map
- **Initial State**: All regions uncolored.
- **Goal Test**: All regions correctly colored with four colors.
- **Successor Function**: Each region can be colored in three ways (since adjacent regions must differ), considering all possible permutations.
- **Cost Function**: Based on the number of regions colored or constraints satisfied.

### Part (b): Monkey and Bananas
- **Initial State**: Monkey at ground level, crates at 3-foot height.
- **Goal Test**: Monkey reaches bananas.
- **Successor Function**: Actions include climbing, moving crates, stacking.
- **Cost Function**: Based on effort or steps taken.

### Part (c): Illegal Input Record
- **Initial State**: All records processed as valid.
- **Goal Test**: Identify the illegal record causing an error.
- **Successor Function**: Test each record independently until the error occurs.
- **Cost Function**: Based on tests conducted or time taken.

### Part (d): Measuring One Gallon with Jugs
- **Initial State**: All jugs empty.
- **Goal Test**: Exactly one gallon measured in a jug.
- **Successor Function**: Actions include filling, emptying, transferring between jugs.
- **Cost Function**: Based on operations or time taken.

Each problem utilizes state-space search techniques to systematically explore possible states, with priority given to those states that promise a quicker solution based on heuristic functions.
