A finite state space indeed results in a finite search tree. This is because the search process can always be structured to follow a path with logarithmic depth relative to the size of the state space. Each comparison or test reduces the problem size by at least 
half, ensuring that the search terminates after a finite number of steps. Therefore, regardless of the complexity or interconnectedness of the underlying state space, a finite search tree is guaranteed.

**Answer:** Yes, a finite state space results in a finite search tree because the process ensures logarithmic depth, guaranteeing termination after a finite number of steps
