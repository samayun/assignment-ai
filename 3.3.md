The SUCCESSOR-FN function can be defined in terms of LEGAL-ACTIONS and RESULT as follows:

SUCCESSOR-FN(s) = {RESULT(a, s) | a ∈ LEGAL-ACTIONS(s)}

This means that the successor function for state s is the set of all states you can transition to by performing each legal action a in LEGAL-ACTIONS(s).

Conversely, LEGAL-ACTIONS(s) can be defined using SUCCESSOR-FN as:

LEGAL-ACTIONS(s) = {a | SUCCESSOR-FN(a, s) ≠ ∅}

This indicates that an action a is considered legal in state s if executing it results in at least one possible successor state.
